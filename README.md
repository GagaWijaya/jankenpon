# jankenpon
This Python OOP project simulates a two-player console game of Janken (the Japanese version of Rock-Paper-Scissors) using object-oriented programming. The game involves a human player and a computer player, both starting with a counter value of 10. The goal is to reduce a player's counter to 0 before the opponent does.
